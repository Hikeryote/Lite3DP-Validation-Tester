Lite3DP Validation Tester by Hikeryote

This STL is an exposure tester designed speficially for the Lite3DP Gen 2 resin printer.

It's useful for dialing in the exposure time on your Lite3DP. It prints pretty quickly!

The design was remixed from the Photonsters Validation Matrix V2, but 
simplified and resized to fit the small bed of the Lite3DP.

Some notes on printing:
- I have only tested it with Anycubic Standard Grey so far, but it should work with any resin
- The thinnest lines in the top row are not likely to print; at .005mm they are smaller than the 3DP's pixel resolution
